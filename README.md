# TPS8-Kaggle

Jupyter Notebooks for the Kaggle competition: Tabular Playground Series August 2021

About the competition:

The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with calculating the loss associated with a loan defaults. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

Type: Regression 

Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error

My repository contains the following notebooks:

* tps8-statistic-eda.ipynb
  * EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* tps8-pycaret-commented.ipynb
  * my first steps with pycaret (automatic model selection and blened prediction with the best models)

* tps8-2step-approach.ipynb
  * attempt to break the problem down into one classification and one regression (failed because classification results were too bad)
